        <h2>Family</h2>

        <h2>School</h2>
        <p>Because I live in Selma, I obviously attend Selma High School. I am going to be a senior, and I look forward to graduating soon. I will go to a four year college after that..</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I don't really have any hobbies. I pretty much stay inside all the time and I don't play any sports. I tried out for basketball in middle school but I didn't make the team. That's it.</p>
